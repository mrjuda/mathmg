        Hi there Home.
        <br />
        The history of mathematics deals with the 
        origin of discoveries in mathematics and 
        the mathematical methods and notation of 
        the past. Before the modern age and the 
        worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples 
        of new mathematical developments have come 
        to light only in a few locales. From 3000 BC 
        the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and 
        Assyria, followed closely by Ancient Egypt 
        and the Levantine state of Ebla began using 
        arithmetic, algebra and geometry for purposes 
        of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the 
        patterns in nature, the field of astronomy and 
        to record time and formulate calendars.
